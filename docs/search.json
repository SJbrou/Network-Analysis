Another employee of your firm suggests merging the two firms and deciding co-operatively\non strategies so as to maximize the sum of profits. Ignoring whether this merger would\nbe allowed by the regulators do you think its a good idea? Explain.\n\nNo. In a merger the maximal profit would be 20M. Assume one firm starts producing product A, the optimal strategy for the other firm is to produce the other product, in which case the total profits of the firms combined would also be 20M. As it is in both firms intrests to follow the cooperative strategy, there is no incentive to merge.",
